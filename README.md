# pypistats-plots

Plots using [pypistats API](https://github.com/hugovk/pypistats).
As it is currently, the API seems to be more "printing tables" oriented rather than "comparing plots" oriented.
Our first interest in creating this addendum project was to gauge relative use of minor Python versions to decide when to cutoff EOL Python versions e.g. Python 3.5.
